            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                A third-person RPG set in a low-poly world, where players control a wizard who can switch between water, fire, and earth elements, 
                as well as a sword-only mode. Each element grants unique abilities and passive effects, altering the player's HP, mana, and damage. The game's 
                theme, 'side effects,' makes clear of the strategic element-switching. Players must defeat three elemental bosses while battling small ghosts in an open-world 
                environment. Additionally, they can collect apples as a healing option.
            </p>
