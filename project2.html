            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                A 3rd person RPG set in a low poly world, where players control a wizard capable of switching between water, fire, earth elements, 
                and a sword-only mode. Each element provides unique abilities and passive effects, changing the player's HP, mana, and damage. The theme 
                of the game while developing it was "side effects", therefore drawing attention to the strategic element-switching mechanic. Players must defeat three main elemental bosses and defeat small ghosts in the open-world map. 
                Additionally, they can collect apples as a healing option.
            </p>
